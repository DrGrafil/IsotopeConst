# IsotopeConst
IsotopeConst is a header only C/C++ constant library for atomic isotopes. It contains a total of 30,924 constants for 3436 Isotopes up to and including Oganesson (element 119) compiled by the [Atomic Mass Data Center](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/). 

## About
This library provides access to the current set of isotope constants found in the [2016 Atomic Mass Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.1088/1674-1137/41/3/030003) done by the [Atomic Mass Data Center](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/). This set is recommended by the [International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)](https://www.iaea.org/) for international use. 

The constants are compiled from the [Atomic Mass Evaluation - AME2016](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/ame2016/mass16.txt). The header file and resulting documentation is generated from this file.

The constant library has data on neutron count, proton count, atomic weight, atomic mass, mass excess and binding energey per A for all known isotopes of elements upto Oganesson (element 119).
## Documentation

All constants are fully documented. You can read the documentation [HERE](https://metex.github.io/IsotopeConst/html/modules.html). If you prefer a pdf it can be found [HERE](https://metex.github.io/IsotopeConst/html/modules.html).  

## Setup

IsotopeConst is a header-only library, and therfore does not need to be compiled. All that needs to be done is copy the IsotopeConst folder to your include directories and add `#include <IsotopeConst/IsotopeConst.hpp>`. 

### Additional Options

By default NISTConst doesn't set the uncertainties associated with all the constants. To add these uncertainties to your program you need to add `#define NISTCONST_UNCERTAINTY` before you include NISTConst. All uncertainties are accessed by just adding `Uncertainty` to a the variable name. For example the uncertainty in the planck constant, `PlanckConstant`, is simply `PlanckConstantUncertainty`.

NISTConst also includes a list of common aliases to all the constants like `c` for speed of light. To add these aliases to your program you need to add `#define NISTCONST_COMMON_SYMBOLS_NAMES` before you include NISTConst. These are seperated out since there are multiple one letter variable definitions. This can result in variable name collisions with existing code if you decide to make all symbols in NISTConst namespace visible without adding the namespace prefix via `using namespace NISTConst;`.

NISTConst by default defines variables as `static constexpr double` for C++ which wont compile on  older compilers. To enable the header to compile on C++98/C++C03  you need to add `#define NISTCONST_PRECXX11` before you include NISTConst.
## Example Usage

```cpp
#define NISTCONST_UNCERTAINTY // To include uncertainties
#define NISTCONST_COMMON_SYMBOLS_NAMES // Common symbols and names for constants.
#define NISTCONST_PRECXX11 //
#include <NISTConst/NISTConst.hpp>

//Calculates the mass defect, the difference between the mass of the atom 
//and the sum of the masses of its parts in unified atomic mass units.
double MassDefectInu(const int atomicNumber, const int massNumber, const double massAtom)
{
	const double protonMass = atomicNumber * NISTConst::protonMassInu;
	const double electronMass = atomicNumber * NISTConst::electronMassInu;
	const double neutronMass = (massNumber - atomicNumber) * NISTConst::neutronMassInu;

	return protonMass + electronMass + neutronMass - massAtom;	
}
```

## FAQ

1. Will you support other languages besides C/C++?

   Yes. We eventually intend to support Swift, GO, Java and a few other languages.

2. Why are you missing _____ constant?

   Currently NISTConst intends to only have the constants defined by CODATA and listed by NIST as well as some common aliases. There are some obvious omitions especially in for atomic constants. Eventually we will release a way to include these "missing" constants. 

3. Why does wikipedia and google disagree with some of your values?

   It is because NISTConst values are frozen to the values present in [CODATA-2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4954402) while google and wikipedia are able to pick values from any source. An example of this is for the mass of the proton. As of 8/8/17:

| Proton Mass | Source |
| --- | --- |
| 1.007276466879 u | NISTConst from NIST/CODATA 2014 |
| 1.007276466879 u | Wikipedia |
| 1.007276466812 u | Google |
| 1.007276466583 u | Latest value from ["High-Precision Measurement of the Protonï¿½s Atomic Mass"](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.033001) |

   The latest value will probably be adopted by both google and wikipedia in the near future.

4. The value of _____ is wrong! Can you change it to ...?

   Check either from [HERE](https://github.com/Metex/NISTConst/blob/master/CODATA/Table%20of%20NIST%20Constant%20CODATA%202014.txt) or [HERE](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/) or [HERE](https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4954402) before e-mailing us. NISTConst sticks stricktly to the values reported by NIST/CODATA. If NISTConst disagrees with NIST/CODATA we will change the value to be in agreement with NIST/CODATA.
